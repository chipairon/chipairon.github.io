Hello there,

I am a full-stack software craftsman. Ruby On Rails web applications are my forte, but I am comfortable on the client side as well as doing devops when needed.

I currently work as lead software developer at [Bergamotte](https://www.bergamotte.fr/)

Previously, I helped companies to bootstrap their ideas into MVPs as well as help them grow their business, from JSON APIs and database optimization to user interface interaction and scalable infrastructures.

I design and implement solutions working with the technologies that are best suited for the task at hand, such as Redis, Elastic Search, relational (MySql, Postgresql) and non-relational databases (Mongodb), Node.js, Memcached, image processing, video streaming, real-time communications and third party service integrations.

For front-end development I am comfortable with a variety of tools and frameworks:

- SASS, LESS and pure CSS styling.
- Haml, Slim, Jade and EJS/underscore templating.
- Bootstrap styling and components.
- Rich client side experiences using React, Redux, Immutable.js, Vue.js, jQuery, Leaflet maps, CSS3 transitions or whatever is needed to get the job done.
- I am confortable with build tools like webpack, gulp.js, brunch and npm.

I also do systems administration tasks when needed such as deployment recipes with Capistrano, server configuration on Amazon EC2 and Linode, docker/compose images, NGINX configuration for subdomains and reverse proxies and daemonization of processes.

I have a crush with Elixir and Flutter for very different reasons and occasionally fiddle around with those.

I work remotely between sunny Valencia and not-so-sunny Berlin. I think remote is the best way to work &lt;3

I am an eager learner and always trying to improve my skills to be the best professional I can.
