Hello there,

I am a full-stack web software craftsman. Ruby On Rails web applications are my forte, but I am comfortable on the client side as well as doing devops when needed.

I currently work as principal engineer at [Bergamotte](https://www.bergamotte.fr/)

Previously, I helped companies bootstrap their ideas into MVPs as well as help them grow their business, from JSON APIs and database optimization to user interface interaction and scalable infrastructures.

I favour pragmatism, light processes and fast iterations.

I’m betting on the Web Platform as the best software distribution mechanism and I’m on the lookout for its evolution and increasing capabilities.

I believe in remote and asynchronous workflows. You'll find me between Paris, sunny Valencia and not-so-sunny Berlin.

I am an eager learner and always trying to improve my skills to be the best professional I can.
